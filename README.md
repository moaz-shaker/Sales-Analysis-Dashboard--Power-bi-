It provides key insights into sales performance, shipping efficiency, and regional revenue distribution.

## üß© Data Model Overview

The data model follows a star schema structure to support efficient reporting and analysis.

- The **fact table** `OrderDetail` contains essential numeric measures such as `LineTotal`, `TaxAmt`, `Freight`, and due dates.
- It connects to several **dimension tables**, including:
  - `Dates`: for filtering and comparing by Order, Ship, and Due Dates.
  - `Products`: for category-based analysis.
  - `SalesPeople`: for performance metrics.
  - `Territories`: for regional insights.
  - `Status` and `ShipMethods`: to analyze order status and shipping channels.

This setup enables flexible time-based comparisons and clear relationship management in the model.
